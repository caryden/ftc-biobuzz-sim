# BIOBUZZ simulator

A browser physics simulator for BIOBUZZ, the 2026-2027 *FIRST* Tech Challenge game, with the results of about 3,600
simulated matches. It is a project of the students and mentors of NCSSM FTC teams 5064, 8569, and 22377.

| Page | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [Ten lessons](https://biobuzz.ncssmftc.org/lessons/) | What to build, what to practice, and how to plan a match, with the numbers behind each lesson |
| [Match Lab](https://biobuzz.ncssmftc.org/lab/) | Configure an alliance, and see its estimated score distribution and its chance of beating an opponent |
| [Simulator](https://biobuzz.ncssmftc.org/sim/) | Four robots play a full match on the official field. Configure each robot, drive with a controller, and review and annotate the match. |

## What the simulator models

- **The field.** The official field CAD supplies every field element. The HIVE is a rigid body on a pivot, calibrated to
  the six tipping cases of the Event Field Setup Guide, section 12.3. See [docs/hive-calibration.md](docs/hive-calibration.md).
- **The robots.** A mecanum drivetrain with a DC motor model, a battery with internal resistance, and a traction limit.
  The intake, the launcher, and FLOWER placement are bulk models with sampled errors, not mechanism physics.
- **The match.** A full 2:30 MATCH with AUTO, the transition, TELEOP, scoring, ranking points, and a PIN referee (G421).
- **The drivers.** Every robot runs an AUTO behavior tree. In TELEOP, a TELEOP tree or a person with a controller drives.

[docs/simulator.md](docs/simulator.md) describes the planner, the AUTO trees, partner coordination, the robot
config, and the review mode.

## Run it

You need Node.js 20 or later.

1. To install the dependencies, run `npm install`.
2. To start the dev server, run `npm run dev`.
3. Open the URL that Vite prints, go to **Simulator**, and then press **Start match**.

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left stick | Drive and strafe |
| Right stick X | Turn |
| LB and RB | Shoot NECTAR and shoot POLLEN |
| LT and RT | Place POLLEN and place NECTAR in a FLOWER |
| Gear icon, or a right-click on a robot | Open the robot config |
| Enter, R, C, M, V | Start, reset, change the camera, mark a moment, and review the match |

To run the tests, run `npm test`. They cover the HIVE calibration, the drivetrain, the behavior-tree runtime, the AUTO trees, the referee, and
full scripted matches, without a browser.

## Run matches without a browser

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npx tsx scripts/match.ts` | Plays one four-robot match and prints a timeline and the final score |
| `npx tsx scripts/eval.ts LABEL` | Plays 24 fixed seeds and reports the combined score and where TELEOP time goes |
| `python3 scripts/eval-compare.py BASE NEW` | Compares two evaluation runs |
| `npx tsx scripts/exp-run.ts GROUP 12 11 101 TAG` | Runs a group of robot designs from `scripts/exp-specs.ts` against the baseline |
| `npx tsx scripts/exp-report.ts` | Pools the design runs into tables |
| `npx tsx scripts/auto-timeline.ts 1001` | Prints the AUTO timeline of the red robots |

The results are in [experiments/](experiments/README.md). Every number on the site comes from a file there.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src/sim/` | The match simulation. It has no DOM and no three.js dependency, so it runs in Node.js. |
| `src/auto/` | The planner: the tree files in `trees/auto/` and `trees/teleop/`, their leaves, tactics, path planning, the path follower, and the defense bookkeeping |
| `src/bt/` | The behavior-tree runtime: coroutines that advance once per physics step. It knows nothing about BIOBUZZ. See [docs/behavior-trees.md](docs/behavior-trees.md). |
| `src/ref/`, `src/render/` | The PIN referee, and the three.js view |
| `src/main.ts`, `src/review.ts`, `src/setup.ts` | The simulator page, the review mode, and the robot setups |
| `src/field-editor.ts`, `src/user-trees.ts` | The field editor for AUTO poses, and the edited trees that the browser keeps |
| `index.html`, `sim/index.html` | The home page and the simulator page. Both are Vite entries. |
| `public/` | The field and ball models, and the built Match Lab and lessons pages |
| `scripts/` | Headless runners, the experiment tools, the model converters, and the site builder |
| `experiments/` | Results and logs of every measured change |
| `traces/` | Annotated matches that drove the planner fixes |
| `functions/`, `server/`, `migrations/`, `wrangler.toml` | The match counter and the tree catalog, on Cloudflare Pages and D1 |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | The checks that every pull request must pass |
| `docs/` | The lessons, the simulator description, the HIVE calibration, the behavior-tree design, and the backlog |

## The site

`npm run build` produces the whole static site in `dist/`. The Match Lab and the lessons page are generated by
`python3 scripts/build-site.py` and committed under `public/`, so the build needs no Python. Run that script after you
change `docs/top-ten.md`, the template, or the result files.

The home page shows a live count of simulated matches and of the countries that they came from.
`functions/api/matches.js` is a Cloudflare Pages Function that keeps the counts in a D1 database, because D1 increments
atomically. It stores a visitor's address only as a salted hash, for one day, and a country only as a count per
two-letter code.

The same database holds the tree catalog: every AUTO and TELEOP tree, with its id, name, and description.
`functions/api/trees.js` answers `GET /api/trees` and `GET /api/trees/ID`. The system trees are the files in
`src/auto/trees/auto/` and `src/auto/trees/teleop/`. The build writes them to `trees/catalog.json`, and the first request after a deployment goes live
copies them into D1, so the catalog always matches the live code, including after a rollback. A preview reads the
deployment's own files, because it has no database.

### Deployment

Cloudflare Pages deploys the site by its Git integration: a merge to `main` deploys to production, and every pull
request gets a preview URL. Branch protection requires the **Build and test** check, so a change that fails its tests
can't reach `main`. The Pages project uses the build command `npm run build` and the output directory `dist`.
`.node-version` pins Node.js 22, and `wrangler.toml` supplies the D1 binding. A preview gets no database binding, so a
preview can't change the real count.

The database schema is in `migrations/`. The last step of `npm run build`, `scripts/migrate-d1.mjs`, applies new
migrations to the production database, but only in a Pages build of `main`, and only when the production environment
has `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. A failed migration fails the build, so the new code doesn't go
live. A migration must be additive, because the old deployment runs against the new schema until the new one is live.

To deploy your own copy, follow these steps:

1. To create the database, run `wrangler d1 create DB_NAME`, and put the ID that it prints in `wrangler.toml`.
2. To create the tables, run `wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote`.
3. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Workers & Pages**, create a Pages project from your fork, and set the build
   command and the output directory as described earlier.
4. Optional: to have production builds apply later migrations, create a Cloudflare API token with **D1 Edit**
   permission. In the Pages project's settings, add it as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, with your account ID as
   `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, in the production environment variables only.

## Sources

- **Field geometry.** The official field CAD from the *FIRST* Playing Field Resources page. `scripts/convert-step.mjs`
  converts the STEP file to `public/field.glb` and writes `cad/field-manifest.json`, and `scripts/convert-balls.mjs`
  extracts the ball models. The STEP file isn't in the repository.
- **Rules and point values.** The BIOBUZZ Competition Manual, sections 9 and 10.
- **HIVE tipping point.** The Event Field Setup Guide, section 12.3.
- **Ball masses.** AndyMark's product page: 0.055 lb for POLLEN (am-5851) and 0.091 lb for NECTAR (am-5852). The
  manual's section 9.8 names the material, polyethylene, and gives no weight. `node scripts/ball-mass.mjs` checks the
  weights against the plastic volume of the CAD models.

## Contribute

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The fastest bug report is an annotated match: review a match in the
simulator, click the robot that did something wrong, type a note, click **Export**, and attach the files to an issue.
